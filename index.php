    <p>This is a Proof-of-concept repository with the ability to merge several dynamic sources.</p>
    <p>It can act as a bridge between places like Github, or it can process other AltStore repositories, removing duplicates and ensuring the most valid source is used where possible</p>
    <p>It is designed to offer the fastest updates from the fastest source available within the backend repository subset.</p>
    <p>The source is available on <a href="https://github.com/PixPMusic/AltRepo">Github</a> and the AltStore link is <a href="altstore://repo?url=https://repo.pixp.cc/repo.json">ADD TO ALTSTORE</a></p>
